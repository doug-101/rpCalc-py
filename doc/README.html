<h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>

<p>rpCalc started out as a small program written to try out various
Python GUI toolkits.  But I ended up using it all the time (it's much
quicker to pull it up than to pull an actual HP calculator out of the
desk), and I made several improvements.  So I decided to make it
available to others who also like RPN calculators.</p>

<p>Since I'm not in the software business, I'm making this program
free for anyone to use, distribute and modify, as long as it is not
incorporated into any proprietary programs.  If you like the software,
feel free to let others know about it.  And let me know what you think
- my e-mail address is doug101 AT bellz DOT org</p>

<h2><a name="features"></a>Features</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Uses reverse polish notation, similar to most Hewlett-Packard
  calculators.</li>

  <li>The number, operator or command text on any key can be typed, or
  the mouse can be used to hit the key.</li>

  <li>If desired, the four RPN registers can be shown in the main
  display.</li>

  <li>A separate window can display the four RPN registers, a history of
  recent calculations, or the contents of the ten memory registers.</li>

  <li>Any values from the extra windows can be copied to the calculator
  display or to the clipboard.</li>

  <li>Options can be set to control the display of numbers and the
  initial window configuration.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="legal"></a>Legal Issues</h2>

under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation; either Version 2 of the License, or (at your

this program for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="sysreq"></a>System Requirements</h2>

<h3><a name="linux-sys"></a>Linux</h3>

<p>rpCalc requires the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li>Qt (Version 4.1 or higher - see <a
    href="http://www.trolltech.com">Trolltech</a> for more information)</li>
  <li>Python (Version 2.3 or higher)</li>
  <li>PyQt (Version 4.0 or higher - see <a
    href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk">Riverbank</a>
    for more information)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>These libraries are relatively new - packages may not be available
for your distribution.  In that case, an earlier version of rpCalc
(0.4.3) that depends on older libraries is still available.</p>

<h3><a name="win-sys"></a>Windows</h3>

<p>Using the files provided in the binary distribution, rpCalc should
run on any computer running Win 95, 98, NT, 2000, or XP.</p>

<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation</h2>

<h3><a name="linux-inst"></a>Linux</h3>

<p>Extract the source files from the rpcalc tar file, then change to the
<tt>rpCalc</tt> directory in a terminal.  For a basic installation,
simply execute the following command as root:  <tt>python
  install.py</tt></p>

<p>To see all install options, use: <tt>python install.py -h</tt></p>

<p>To install rpCalc with a different prefix (the default is
<tt>/usr/local</tt>), use:  <tt>python install.py -p
  /prefix/path</tt></p>

<h3><a name="win-inst"></a>Windows</h3>

<p>Simply execute the downloaded installation file
(<tt>rpcalc-x.x.x-install.exe</tt>).  It will install the program
with its libraries and optionally create shortcuts.</p>

<p>If you wish to modify the source code or write your own PyQt programs
for Windows, do not use the above procedure.  Instead, you need to
install <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, <a
  href="http://www.trolltech.com">Qt</a>, and <a
  href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk">PyQt</a>.  Then extract the
source code and data files from the Linux version (rpcalc tar file) to a
directory of your choice and execute the <tt>rpcalc.py</tt> file.</p>

<h2><a name="using"></a>Using rpCalc</h2>

<h3><a name="basics"></a>Basics</h3>

<p>If you know how to use an RPN calculator (like Hewlett-Packard
models), you know how to use rpCalc.  It stores previous results in
four registers (usually labeled X, Y, Z and T), and the numbers are
entered before the operators.</p>

<p>The quickest way to enter numbers and the four basic operators is to
use the number pad on the keyboard.  For the other keys, the name on the
key can be typed (not case-sensitive).  What has been typed shows up in
the box below the keys.  The tab key may be used to automatically
complete a partially typed command.  Of course, the mouse may also be
used to hit any key.</p>

<p>A few keys have unusual labels to allow them to be typed:  "RCIP"
is 1/X, "tn^X" is 10^X, "R&lt;" rolls the stack back (or down),
"R&gt;" rolls the stack forward (or up), "x&lt;&gt;y" is exchange,
"CLR" clears the registers, and "&lt;-" is backspace.</p>

<p>A few commands ("STO", "RCL" and "PLCS") prompt for a number from
zero through nine.  This number will be the memory register number or
the number of decimal places for the display.</p>

<h3><a name="info-win"></a>Information Windows</h3>

<p>A menu can be displayed by hitting the Esc key or by clicking on the
main number (LCD) display with the right mouse button.  This menu has
commands to display a list of registers, a calculation history list, and
a memory contents list.  These commands will create a new window with
the requested information.  The extra window is tabbed to toggle between
the three lists.  Buttons on the window can be used to copy the numbers
to the calculator (X-register) or to the clipboard (with buttons to copy
either all decimal places or the formatted fixed decimal place number).
The register list shows the register contents to full precision, with
all available decimal places shown.</p>

<h3><a name="option"></a>Options</h3>

<p>The OPT key will show an options dialog box.  This includes settings
for showing the extra data window at startup, for display parameters and
for angular unit selection.  This box also has a button that, like the
menu mentioned above, will show the extra data window with the register,
history and memory information.  In addition, the view registers option
will show the contents of all four RPN registers on the main display.
Note that the display parameters and the angle unit can also be changed
using dedicated keys.</p> 

<h2><a name="revs"></a>Revision History</h2>

<h3>August 14, 2008 - Release 0.6.0</h3>

<ul><b>New features:</b>

  <li>A new base conversion dialog was added.  It shows values in
  hexadecimal, octal and binary bases.  Push buttons or keyboard
  prefixes can be used to allow entry of a value in one of these
  bases.</li>

  <li>A display option was added to separate thousands with spaces in
  the main "LCD".</li>

  <li>An engineering notation display option was added that only shows
  exponents that are divisible by three.</li>

</ul>

<h3>October 3, 2006 - Release 0.5.0</h3>

<ul><b>New features:</b>

  non-commercial license exception in Windows.</li>

</ul>

<ul><b>Updates:</b>

  <li>On Windows, the rpCalc.ini file has been moved from the
  installation directory to a location under the "Documents and
  Settings" folder.  This avoids problems on multi-user systems and for
  users with limited access rights.</li>

</ul>

<h3>March 12, 2004 - Release 0.4.3</h3>

<ul><b>New features:</b>

  <li>The size and position of the main and extra windows are now saved

  The return key is no longer needed to finish a command, and hitting
  the tab key auto-completes a partial command.</li>

  <li>Since it is no longer needed for entering commands, the return key
  is now equivalent to the enter key.</li>

  <li>New keys have been added for setting display and angle options.
  "PLCS" prompts for the number of decimal places, "SCI" toggles between
  fixed and scientific display, and "DEG" toggles between degree and
  radian settings.  There is also a new status indicator in the lower
  right corner for these options.</li>

  <li>A new "SHOW" key temporarily toggles to a scientific display
  showing 12 significant figures.  The display goes back to normal after
  the next command or if the "SHOW" command is repeated.</li>

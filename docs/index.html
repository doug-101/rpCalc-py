            <h1>What is rpCalc?</h1>

            <p>rpCalc started out as a little program written to try out
            various Python GUI toolkits.  But I ended up using it all the time
            (it's much quicker to pull it up than to pull an actual HP
            calculator out of the desk), and I made several improvements.  So I
            decided to make it available to others who also like RPN
            calculators.</p>

            <p>In addition to this installed version, there is also an online
            version, written in JavaScript. See <a
            href="http://rpcalc-js.bellz.org">rpcalc-js.bellz.org</a> to try
            it out.</p>

            <p>A source code repository is available at <a
            href="https://github.com/doug-101/rpCalc-py">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h1>News</h1>

            <h2>April 8, 2018 - Release 0.8.2</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Added a desktop file to the Linux version to provide menu
                entries.</li>

              <li>Built the Windows version with an updated version of the GUI
                library.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>February 4, 2017 - Release 0.8.1 (Linux only)</h2>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Replaced outdated dependency checks in the Linux installer -
                it now runs checks for Qt5 libraries.</li>

              <li>Fixed a timing issue in the Linux installer so that
                byte-compiled files do not have old timestamps.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>January 15, 2017 - Release 0.8.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>rpCalc has been ported from the Qt4 to the Qt5 library.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>December 6, 2015 - Release 0.7.1</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Clarified some dependency checker error messages in the
              Linux installer.</li>

              <li>Added some MSVC runtime DLL files to the Windows installers
              to avoid problems on PCs that do not already have them.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed problems responding to some keyboard presses when the
              shift key is used on Windows.</li>

            </ul>


            <h2>January 26, 2014 - Release 0.7.0</h2>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>rpCalc has been ported from Python 2 to Python 3.  This
              porting includes some code cleanup.</li>

              <li>The Windows binaries are built using more recent Python, Qt
              and PyQt libraries.</li>

              <li>There is an additional Windows installer for users without
              administrator rights and for portable installations.</li>

              <li>Added an installer option to add a config file to the
              program's directory for portable installations.  If that file is
              present, no config files will be written to users'
              directories.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 14, 2008 - Release 0.6.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>A new base conversion dialog was added.  It shows values in
              hexadecimal, octal and binary bases.  Push buttons or keyboard
              prefixes can be used to allow entry of a value in one of these
              bases.</li>

              <li>A colon (":") can optionally be used as a prefix when typing
              commands.  This is useful in hexadecimal entry mode for commands
              starting with letters "A" through "F".</li>

              <li>New options have been added for alternate base conversions.
              The number of bits and whether to use two's complement for
              negative numbers can be set.</li>

              <li>A display option was added to separate thousands with spaces
              in the main "LCD".</li>

              <li>An engineering notation display option was added that only
              shows exponents that are divisible by three.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Keyboard number and function entry continue to work when the
              Extra Data window has focus.</li>

              <li>The ReadMe file has been updated.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>October 3, 2006 - Release 0.5.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>rpCalc was ported to the Qt4 library. This involved a
              significant rewrite of the code.  The previous versions used
              Qt3.x on Linux and Qt2.3 on Windows.  Benefits include
              updated widgets and removal of the non-commercial license
              exception in Windows.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>On Windows, the rpCalc.ini file has been moved from the
              installation directory to a location under the "Documents
              and Settings" folder.  This avoids problems on multi-user
              systems and for users with limited access rights.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>March 12, 2004 - Release 0.4.3</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>The size and position of the main and extra windows are
              now saved at exit.</li>

              <li>An install program has been added for windows.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed Linux install script problems with certain versions
              of Python.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>November 17, 2003 - Release 0.4.2</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Allow the use of commas in addition to periods as decimal
              points to accomodate European keyboards.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>An install script was added for Linux and Unix systems.</li>

              <li>The windows build now uses Python version 2.3 and PyQt
              version 3.8.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>July 14, 2003 - Release 0.4.1</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Added an option to remove the LCD display highlight.
              This is useful for smaller displays</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed a problem with the option to display the
              extra data view on startup.</li>
              
            </ul>

            <h2>April 30, 2003 - Release 0.4.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>The main display can optionally be expanded to
              show lines for the Y, Z, &amp; T registers.</li>

              <li>The three separate views for extra data
              (registers, history &amp; memory) have been replaced
              with a single tabbed view.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Icon files are now provided with the distributed
              files.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Crashes caused by some calculation overflows
              have been fixed.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>February 27, 2003 - Release 0.3.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>The typing of multiple-letter command names has been made
              easier.  The return key is no longer needed to finish a
              command, and hitting the tab key auto-completes a partial
              command.</li>

              <li>Since it is no longer needed for entering commands, the
              return key is now equivalent to the enter key.</li>

              <li>New keys have been added for setting display and angle
              options.  "PLCS" prompts for the number of decimal places,
              "SCI" toggles between fixed and scientific display, and "DEG"
              toggles between degree and radian settings.  There is also a
              new status indicator in the lower right corner for these
              options.</li>

              <li>A new "SHOW" key temporarily toggles to a scientific
              display showing 12 significant figures.  The display goes
              back to normal after the next command or if the "SHOW"
              command is repeated.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>May 28, 2002 - Release 0.2.2a</h2>

              includes section links.</li>

              <li>The binaries for windows have been updated to Python
              2.2 and PyQt 3.2 (but are still using Qt 2.3
              Non-commercial).</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>March 19, 2002 - Website Update</h2>

            <ul>This website now looks a little better.  Hopefully, it's
              more user-friendly, too.</ul>

            <ul>Stay tuned - I'll soon be porting these programs to use
              PyQt with Qt 3.0.</ul>
